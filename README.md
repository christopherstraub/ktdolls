# KTDolls
KTDolls is a beautiful, modern, and responsive website built with Jekyll for my client who previously had a costly and unsightly website built with GoDaddy's website builder. The website is setup with the Forestry.io headless CMS so my client can easily edit and upload new content to their site, as they frequently need to do so. By delivering this product to my client they were able to cut their yearly costs by $240, improve their workflow and engage their clientele with a more authentic website and better user experience.
