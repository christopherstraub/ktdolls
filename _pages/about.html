ragdoll-history-heading: RAGDOLL HISTORY
ragdoll-history-body:
  The Ragdoll is a cat breed with blue eyes and varying colours
  and patterns. It is a large and muscular semi-longhair cat with a soft and silky
  coat. Like all long haired cats, Ragdolls need grooming to ensure that their fur
  does not mat. It is recommended Ragdolls are given baths once a month. Developed
  by American breeder Ann Baker in the 1960s, it is best known for its docile and
  placid temperament and affectionate nature. The name "Ragdoll" is derived from the
  tendency of individuals from the original breeding stock to go limp and relaxed
  when picked up. Particularly popular in both the United Kingdom and the breed's
  native United States, ragdoll cats often are known as "dog-like cats" or "puppy-like
  cats" due to behaviors such as their tendency to follow people around, their ease
  at being physically handled, and their relative lack of aggression toward other
  pets.
mink-ragdoll-heading: WHAT IS A MINK RAGDOLL?
mink-ragdoll-body:
  Mink Ragdolls have a thicker, plusher coat than traditional Ragdolls,
  often with an extremely plush tail. The coat of a mink is smoother and much softer
  than traditional Ragdolls. Minks usually have aqua colored eyes (sea blue green)
  instead of the blue eyes that the traditional Ragdolls have.
